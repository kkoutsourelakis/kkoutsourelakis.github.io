My research interests lie at the interface of synthetic and medicinal chemistry, where molecular design principles converge with biological function to address challenges in therapeutic discovery. During my summer internship in Professor Angela Casini’s Medicinal and Bioinorganic Chemistry group at the Technical University of Munich, Germany, and through my current work in the Taylor Lab at William & Mary, I have explored how chemical synthesis can inform biological mechanisms and guide the development of novel therapeutics. 

## Research Experience

### Medicinal and Bioinorganic Chemistry with Professor Angela Casini

In Professor Casini’s group, I gained interdisciplinary experience that deepened my commitment to pursuing graduate research. I worked on three projects that integrated organometallic chemistry, peptide synthesis, and analytical tagging strategies for anticancer research.

#### Ruthenium–Picolinic Complexes for Redox-Active Therapeutics
I synthesized ruthenium–picolinic (2) and –picolinamide complexes (4) designed as redox-active therapeutic candidates capable of inducing reductive stress in cancer cells ([Figure 1](#fig1)). Through ligand modification and hydride formation experiments, I examined how subtle electronic and structural changes affect the stability and redox potential of the resulting complexes. Using NMR analyses, I confirmed successful hydride formation. This work revealed structure-activity relationships in transition-metal redox chemistry and inspired my interest in the power of rational ligand design for biocompatible catalytic systems.

#### Peptide Synthesis and On-Resin Cyclization  
Additionally, I contributed to the solid-phase synthesis and on-resin cyclization of peptides, constructing an oligopeptide sequence through iterative coupling and deprotection steps (6) ([Figure 2](#fig2))). This project honed my skills in reaction optimization and purification, with mass spectrometry confirming successful peptide synthesis. Although gold complex coupling was unsuccessfully attempted, the work deepened my understanding of selectivity challenges in peptide assembly and sparked my interest in designing metal-peptide conjugates and cyclic scaffolds for drug delivery.

#### Ruthenium-Based Mass Tags for Proteomic Imaging
In a third project, I worked on developing ruthenium-based mass tags for mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) to map biomolecules in tissues with high spatial resolution. I synthesized indole–pyridine derivatives and biotin-based linkers (10), optimizing purification using flash chromatography ([Figure 3](#fig3)). This project demonstrated how organometallic synthesis can enhance analytical sensitivity through isotopically distinct tagging and inspired my interest in click-chemistry approaches for bioorthogonal, site-specific labeling in proteomic imaging and drug distribution studies.

### Organic Synthesis and Bacterial Virulence Inhibition in the Taylor Lab

More recently, I have joined the Taylor Lab at William & Mary, where I am expanding my training in organic synthesis of small molecules and exploring the chemical mechanisms underlying bacterial virulence regulation. I am currently synthesizing meta-bromo-thiolactone (mBTL), a small molecule that inhibits quorum sensing in *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*. Using a two-step route involving acid formation (12) and amide coupling with homocysteine thiolactone (15), I am learning to construct the thiolactone core of mBTL ([Figure 4](#fig4))). mBTL binds to bacterial quorum-sensing receptors to disrupt bacterial communication and virulence, offering a promising anti-virulence strategy that reduces antibiotic resistance pressure. This project has allowed me to apply my synthetic background to a biologically relevant target and appreciate how small-molecule chemistry can modulate complex cellular behavior.

## Research Skills and Future Directions

Through these projects, I developed proficiency in synthetic organic and organometallic chemistry, solid-phase peptide synthesis, and analytical characterization. I learned to view chemical synthesis as a tool to interrogate and manipulate biological systems, which has fueled my curiosity about the molecular principles underlying complex cellular behavior. I am particularly excited by the prospect of designing molecules that reveal mechanistic insights into cellular processes, such as redox regulation in cancer or quorum-sensing pathways in pathogenic bacteria. 

My experiences in the Casini and Taylor labs have taught me that careful, hypothesis-driven synthesis can illuminate unexpected connections between chemical structure and biological effect. I am excited to continue pursuing research that combines creativity, precision, and impact at the interface of chemistry and biology.
