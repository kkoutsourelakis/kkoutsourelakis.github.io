# Short Statement of Purpose

My research interests lie at the interface of **synthetic and medicinal chemistry**, where molecular design principles converge with biological function to address challenges in therapeutic discovery. I view chemical synthesis as a **tool to interrogate and manipulate biological systems**, which has fueled my curiosity about the molecular principles underlying complex cellular behavior.  

I am particularly excited by the prospect of designing molecules that reveal mechanistic insights into cellular processes, such as **redox regulation in cancer** or **quorum-sensing pathways in pathogenic bacteria**. My experiences have taught me that **careful, hypothesis-driven synthesis** can illuminate unexpected connections between chemical structure and biological effect.
